# Dern [<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kirdow/Dern">](https://github.com/Kirdow/Dern/blob/master/LICENSE)
An interpreted custom programming language made by me initially in 2013-2014, now made anew from scratch. Name is the same used during that time, but the code is completely new.

## Why the name 'Dern'?
Back then it was a made up name, and still is in my opinion. I have learned it means ``Dark`` or ``Hidden`` which somewhat fits my style in a way, but this isn't my intention. The name actually comes from my own name, by taking the first two letters of my first name, and concatenate them with the first and last letter of my last name.
